# Structure

The editor has different components, each with its own purpose. This guide will help you understand the different parts and how they interact with each other. The whole program is architectured around the [Model-View-Controller pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC pattern).

## MVC Pattern

The MVC pattern is a design pattern that separates the application into three main components: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**.

- **Model**: The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller, processes it, and updates the view.
- **View**: The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It receives data from the model and renders it on the screen.
- **Controller**: The controller is responsible for handling user input and updating the model.

## Editor

The editor is the **Controller** in the MVC pattern. It is responsible for handling user input and updating the model. The editor is the main component of the program and is responsible for managing the different parts of the application.

## File

The file is the **Model** in the MVC pattern. It is responsible for managing the data of the application. For this editor, the text is stored in a [rope data structure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)>) to allow efficient editing of large files. This is provided by the [ropey](https://docs.rs/ropey/) crate.

## Draw

The drawing part - text rendering - is the **View** in the MVC pattern. It is responsible for displaying the data to the user.
`Giga`uses the [termion](https://docs.rs/termion/) crate to render the text on the screen.
